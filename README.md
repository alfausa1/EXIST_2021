# EXIST 2021
Sexism Identification in Social Networks task proposal.

## About The Project

[EXIST](http://nlp.uned.es/exist2021/) is an NLP competition task organized at [IberLEF 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/iberlef2021/organization) with the purpose of creating models capable of identifying sexism in text from social networks such as Twitter or Gab.

With the purpose of being the best possible in the ranking of the task, we have carried out three different approaches in Python. You can check all of them in the [Notebooks](https://github.com/alfausa1/EXIST_2021/tree/master/Notebooks) folder: 
* BERT with HuggingFace pretrained Transformers
  - [Fine tunning](https://github.com/alfausa1/EXIST_2021/blob/master/Notebooks/BERT_Tunning.ipynb)
  - [Predictions](https://github.com/alfausa1/EXIST_2021/blob/master/Notebooks/BERT_Predicts.ipynb)
* Feature Extraction: IDF and Word Embeddings
  - [Training](https://github.com/alfausa1/EXIST_2021/blob/master/Notebooks/FeatureExtraction_Train.ipynb)
